# Hello, S3!

This is the code project for the [Hello, S3!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-s3) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon S3. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon S3 and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" activity on the AWS console, followed by a programmatic example of using S3 in a .NET report program. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, S3 Project

We have two Hello, Cloud activities for S3. Part 1 explores working with buckets and objects in the AWS console. Part 2 is a .NET programmatic example, a monthly time and billing report program that uses S3 to hold employee timesheets as well as the report it generates. It uses the AWS SDK for .NET to interact with S3.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
